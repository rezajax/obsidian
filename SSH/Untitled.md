ssh -R 1080:localhost:1080 root@107.175.73.102 says to termux use 7300 port for udp

It seems like you're trying to establish a reverse SSH tunnel using the command:

bash

Copy code

`ssh -R 1080:localhost:1080 root@107.175.73.102`

This command is intended to forward port 1080 from the remote server (107.175.73.102) to your local machine's port 1080, effectively allowing access to services running on localhost:1080 through the remote server.

The message about using port 7300 for UDP in Termux suggests that there might be a conflict or a specific requirement related to UDP traffic when using SSH with Termux.

Here's what might be happening:

1. **UDP over SSH**: If you're trying to tunnel UDP traffic (which is common for protocols like DNS or certain VPN setups), SSH by default only handles TCP traffic. You might need a different approach, such as using `ssh -w` for tunneling UDP.
    
2. **Termux Configuration**: Termux, being a mobile terminal emulator, could have its own limitations or configurations that affect how SSH tunnels are handled. If it's telling you to use port 7300 for UDP, it may be related to some internal configuration or requirement for Termux's networking.
    

To forward UDP traffic through SSH, you can try using `-w` (tunnel for devices with a virtual network interface) like so:

bash

Copy code

`ssh -w 0:0 -R 1080:localhost:1080 root@107.175.73.102`

This sets up a tunnel for both TCP and UDP traffic. Ensure that port 7300 is open if you need to use it for UDP traffic.
