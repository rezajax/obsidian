## 🧠 Common Noun vs. Proper Noun (Quick Summary)

### 🔹 Common Noun  
A **common noun** is a **general name** for people, places, or things.  
It is usually **not capitalized** unless it comes at the beginning of a sentence.  
🧾 Example: city, teacher, river

### 🔸 Proper Noun  
A **proper noun** is a **specific name** for a person, place, or thing.  
It is **always capitalized**.  
• Refers to a **specific person, place, or object**  
• Usually **not pluralized**  
• **Always starts with a capital letter**

🧾 Example: Reza, Iran, Google


## 📚 Plural Nouns – How to Make Common Nouns Plural

### 🔹 Basic Rule:
Most **common nouns** become plural by **adding `-s`** to the end.

🧾 Example:  
- book → books  
- cat → cats  
- table → tables  

---

### 🔸 Special Rule: Add `-es`
If a noun ends in: **-ch**, **-sh**, **-x**, **-s**, or **-z**,  
→ Add **`-es`** to make it plural.

🧾 Examples:  
- bus → buses  
- box → boxes  
- watch → watches  
- dish → dishes  

---

### ℹ️ Tip:
This rule helps with pronunciation — adding `-es` makes the plural easier to say when the word ends in a hissing or buzzing sound.

---

📌 You can add more rules later like:
- nouns ending in -y → change to -ies  
- irregular plurals: man → men, child → children  
(Let me know if you want those too!)
