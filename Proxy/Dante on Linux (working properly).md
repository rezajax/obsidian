To create a SOCKS5 server on a Linux machine using the terminal, you can use `dante-server`, a popular option for setting up a SOCKS proxy. Here's how to do it:

### Step 1: Install Dante Server

First, you need to install Dante. Use the following command to install it:

bash

Copy code

`sudo apt update sudo apt install dante-server`

### Step 2: Configure Dante Server

The configuration file for Dante is usually located at `/etc/danted.conf`. You need to edit it to configure your SOCKS5 server.

bash

Copy code

`sudo nano /etc/danted.conf`

Here is a sample configuration for a SOCKS5 server:

```
logoutput: /var/log/danted.log

# Internal network interface
internal: eth0 port = 1080

# External network interface (use the IP of your server)
external: eth0

method: username none

clientmethod: none
user.notprivileged: nobody

# Allow connections from any IP (you can restrict this to specific IPs)
client pass {
    from: 0.0.0.0/0 to: 0.0.0.0/0
    log: connect disconnect error
}

# Allow the SOCKS5 traffic
socks pass {
    from: 0.0.0.0/0 to: 0.0.0.0/0
    log: connect disconnect error
}

```
- The `internal` directive specifies the interface and port the server will listen on (`1080` in this example).
- The `external` directive specifies the external network interface.
- The `method` is set to `username none` to allow connections without authentication (you can change this to add a username/password requirement).
- The `socks pass` section allows the traffic to pass through.

### Step 3: Start the Dante Server

After saving the configuration, start the Dante server:

bash

Copy code

`sudo systemctl restart danted`

To ensure it starts on boot, enable the service:

bash

Copy code

`sudo systemctl enable danted`

### Step 4: Verify the SOCKS5 Server is Running

You can check if the server is running by using `netstat`:

bash

Copy code

`sudo netstat -tuln | grep 1080`

You should see something like:

plaintext

Copy code

`tcp   0   0 0.0.0.0:1080       0.0.0.0:*           LISTEN`

This confirms that the SOCKS5 server is listening on port `1080`.

### Step 5: Connect to the SOCKS5 Server

Now you can configure any SOCKS5-compatible client to connect to your server using the server's IP address and port `1080`.

Does it support udp?

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Yes, **Dante** does support UDP traffic, which is a requirement for many applications like gaming or VoIP that rely on UDP for communication. However, setting up UDP support in Dante requires additional configuration.

To enable UDP support for your SOCKS5 server with Dante, you need to modify the `danted.conf` configuration file and make sure that both TCP and UDP traffic are allowed.

### Step 1: Modify the `danted.conf` File

Open the configuration file for editing:

bash

Copy code

`sudo nano /etc/danted.conf`

Then, update your configuration to explicitly allow both TCP and UDP traffic. Below is an example:

```bash
logoutput: /var/log/danted.log

# Internal network interface
internal: eth0 port = 1080

# External network interface (use the IP of your server)
external: eth0

method: username none

clientmethod: none
user.notprivileged: nobody

# Allow connections from any IP (you can restrict this to specific IPs)
client pass {
    from: 0.0.0.0/0 to: 0.0.0.0/0
    log: connect disconnect error
}

# Allow both TCP and UDP SOCKS5 traffic
socks pass {
    from: 0.0.0.0/0 to: 0.0.0.0/0
    protocol: tcp udp
    log: connect disconnect error
}
```

rez: use this:
```bash

# Internal network interface
internal: enp5s0 port = 1080

# External network interface (use the IP of your server)
external: enp5s0

method: username none

clientmethod: none
user.notprivileged: nobody

# Allow connections from any IP (you can restrict this to specific IPs)
client pass {
    from: 0.0.0.0/0 to: 0.0.0.0/0
    log: connect disconnect error
}

# Allow both TCP and UDP SOCKS5 traffic
socks pass {
    from: 0.0.0.0/0 to: 0.0.0.0/0
    protocol: tcp udp
    log: connect disconnect error
}
```

### Step 2: Restart Dante Server

After making the changes, restart the Dante server:

bash

Copy code

`sudo systemctl restart danted`

### Step 3: Verify UDP Support

To confirm that UDP traffic is being handled correctly, you can use tools like `netstat` to check the open UDP port:

bash

Copy code

`sudo netstat -uln | grep 1080`

You should see a line indicating that port `1080` is open for UDP as well as TCP.

### Step 4: Test UDP Functionality

To test that UDP traffic is working, you can try using a client that supports both TCP and UDP through SOCKS5 (such as a compatible web browser or application). Alternatively, you can use tools like `nc` (netcat) to test UDP connectivity.

listen to dante for resived data

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

To monitor the data received by your Dante SOCKS5 server (or any network service), you can use various tools such as `tcpdump` or `wireshark` to capture the network traffic on the relevant port (e.g., port 1080 for Dante).

Here’s how you can use `tcpdump` to listen to the data received by Dante on port 1080:

### Step 1: Install `tcpdump`

If you don't have `tcpdump` installed, you can install it using the following command:

bash

Copy code

`sudo apt install tcpdump`

### Step 2: Capture Traffic on Port 1080 (Dante SOCKS5)

To capture both TCP and UDP traffic on port 1080 (the default port for Dante), you can use the following `tcpdump` command:

bash

Copy code

`sudo tcpdump -i eth0 port 1080`

- `-i eth0` specifies the network interface to capture traffic on (replace `eth0` with the actual interface you’re using, such as `enp3s0` if needed).
- `port 1080` tells `tcpdump` to capture traffic on port 1080 (the default port for SOCKS5 servers).

### Step 3: Capture Both TCP and UDP

By default, `tcpdump` will capture both TCP and UDP traffic. If you want to be more specific or filter by just UDP or TCP traffic, you can use:

- For UDP:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo tcpdump -i eth0 udp port 1080`
    
- For TCP:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo tcpdump -i eth0 tcp port 1080`
    

### Step 4: Analyze the Output

Once you run the command, you'll start seeing the raw packet data. The output will show packets captured in real-time, including source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocol details.

For example, you might see something like:

plaintext

Copy code

`15:24:32.576039 IP 192.168.1.100.54321 > 192.168.1.1.1080: UDP, length 64 15:24:32.576112 IP 192.168.1.1.1080 > 192.168.1.100.54321: UDP, length 64`

This will show the source and destination IPs and ports, and the length of the packets being sent.

### Step 5: Stop the Capture

To stop capturing the packets, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

### Optional: Saving Captured Data to a File

If you want to save the captured traffic to a file for later analysis, use the `-w` option:

bash

Copy code

`sudo tcpdump -i eth0 port 1080 -w dante_traffic.pcap`

You can then open the `dante_traffic.pcap` file with a tool like **Wireshark** to analyze the data more easily.

telnet

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

`Telnet` is a simple command-line tool used to connect to remote servers and devices via the Telnet protocol, typically used for testing network services or troubleshooting.

To use `telnet` to connect to a SOCKS5 server like Dante, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install `telnet`

If you don’t have `telnet` installed on your system, you can install it using:

bash

Copy code

`sudo apt install telnet`

### Step 2: Use `telnet` to Connect to the Dante Server

Assuming your Dante server is running on port `1080` (the default SOCKS5 port), you can use `telnet` to connect to the server:

bash

Copy code

`telnet <server_ip> 1080`

Replace `<server_ip>` with the IP address of the machine where the Dante SOCKS5 server is running.

For example:

bash

Copy code

`telnet 192.168.1.100 1080`

### Step 3: Testing the Connection

Once connected, if the server is up and running correctly, you will see a blank screen or a response indicating that the connection has been established. However, Telnet by itself doesn't support the SOCKS protocol, so it won't allow you to make real SOCKS5 requests.

### Step 4: Using Telnet for Debugging SOCKS5 Traffic

While `telnet` can't be used to make SOCKS5 requests, you can still use it to check if the port is open and if the server is responding. If the connection fails or hangs, this could indicate an issue with the server or firewall.

### Step 5: Telnet for Testing Other Ports

You can use `telnet` to test other services and ports (like HTTP, SMTP, or custom services). For example, to test a web server:

bash

Copy code

`telnet example.com 80`

This will connect to port 80 (HTTP) on `example.com`, and you can then manually send HTTP requests to the server.

### Example of Sending an HTTP Request Using Telnet:

After connecting to a web server on port 80, you can manually type an HTTP request like this:

plaintext

Copy code

`GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com`

Then, press Enter twice to send the request.

### Step 6: Exit Telnet

To exit the `telnet` session, type:

bash

Copy code

`quit`
