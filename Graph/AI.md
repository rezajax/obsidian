Obsidian doesn't natively support 
for diagrams, but it does support diagramming tools like **Mermaid** and **PlantUML** through plugins. If you're specifically looking to use **yFiles** (a Java-based diagramming tool), you would likely need to integrate it manually or use external tools to generate diagrams and then embed them in your Obsidian notes.

Let me know if you'd like more details on using specific diagramming tools in Obsidian!

Graph View obsidian With what technology is it made? Did they develop it themselves?

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

The **Graph View** in Obsidian is built using **D3.js**, a powerful JavaScript library for creating interactive data visualizations, especially network graphs. While **D3.js** is the main technology behind the graph rendering, Obsidian's team has developed their own custom code to integrate it with their Markdown-based system, allowing users to visualize relationships between notes as nodes and edges in a graph.

So, while the underlying technology is **D3.js**, Obsidianâ€™s team has tailored the Graph View to fit their specific needs and the app's unique features, such as navigating between linked notes, customizing graph appearance, and maintaining performance with large sets of data.

Would you like more details on how the graph works or how to customize it?
