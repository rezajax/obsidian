The best path to install or place applications in Linux Mint depends on whether the software is system-wide, user-specific, or manually managed. Here are some recommended paths:

---

### **1. `/opt/`**

- **Purpose**: For manually installed software that isn’t managed by the package manager (e.g., tarballs, binaries).
- **When to use**:
- For [[proprietary]] software (e.g., Chrome, Discord, VS Code).
    - For large, standalone applications.
- **How to use**:
    1. Extract or install the application into `/opt/`:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `sudo tar -xvf app.tar.gz -C /opt/`
        
    2. Create a symbolic link to make it accessible:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `sudo ln -s /opt/<application-folder>/bin/<binary> /usr/local/bin/<application-name>`
        
- **Example**:
    - Installing a standalone binary like Slack or IntelliJ IDEA.

### **2. `/usr/local/`**

- **Purpose**: For software manually compiled and installed by the user.
- **When to use**:
    - For custom-built or compiled-from-source applications.
    - For user-specific software that doesn’t interfere with system-managed `/usr/`.
- **How to use**:
    1. Install binaries to `/usr/local/bin/`:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `sudo make && sudo make install`
        
    2. Place libraries in `/usr/local/lib/` if needed.
- **Example**:
    - Manually compiling software like `htop` or `ffmpeg`.

---

### **3. `$HOME/.local/`**

- **Purpose**: For user-specific applications (no root required).
- **When to use**:
    - If you don’t want to affect system-wide configurations.
- **How to use**:
    - Install binaries in `~/.local/bin/`.
    - Place libraries or dependencies in `~/.local/lib/`.
- **Example**:
    - Python virtual environments or local user-only programs.

---

### **4. `/srv/`**

- **Purpose**: For web services or server-based applications.
- **When to use**:
    - For server-related software or content (e.g., web servers like Apache, Nginx).
- **Example**:
    - Hosting a web app in `/srv/http/`.

---

### **Best Practices**:

- Use `/opt/` for proprietary or precompiled software.
- Use `/usr/local/` for compiled software or tools you want available system-wide.
- Use `~/.local/` for user-specific tools.
