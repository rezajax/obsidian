The best path to install or place applications in Linux Mint depends on whether the software is system-wide, user-specific, or manually managed. Here are some recommended paths:

---

### **1. `/opt/`**

- **Purpose**: For manually installed software that isn’t managed by the package manager (e.g., tarballs, binaries).
- **When to use**:
- For [[proprietary]] software (e.g., Chrome, Discord, VS Code).
    - For large, standalone applications.
- **How to use**:
    1. Extract or install the application into `/opt/`:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `sudo tar -xvf app.tar.gz -C /opt/`
        
    2. Create a symbolic link to make it accessible:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `sudo ln -s /opt/<application-folder>/bin/<binary> /usr/local/bin/<application-name>`
        
- **Example**:
    - Installing a standalone binary like Slack or IntelliJ IDEA.

---

### **2. `/usr/local/`**

- **Purpose**: For software manually compiled and installed by the user.
- **When to use**:
    - For custom-built or compiled-from-source applications.
    - For user-specific software that doesn’t interfere with system-managed `/usr/`.
- **How to use**:
    1. Install binaries to `/usr/local/bin/`:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `sudo make && sudo make install`
        
    2. Place libraries in `/usr/local/lib/` if needed.
- **Example**:
    - Manually compiling software like `htop` or `ffmpeg`.

---

### **3. `$HOME/.local/`**

- **Purpose**: For user-specific applications (no root required).
- **When to use**:
    - If you don’t want to affect system-wide configurations.
- **How to use**:
    - Install binaries in `~/.local/bin/`.
    - Place libraries or dependencies in `~/.local/lib/`.
- **Example**:
    - Python virtual environments or local user-only programs.

---

### **4. `/srv/`**

- **Purpose**: For web services or server-based applications.
- **When to use**:
    - For server-related software or content (e.g., web servers like Apache, Nginx).
- **Example**:
    - Hosting a web app in `/srv/http/`.

---

### **Best Practices**:

- Use `/opt/` for proprietary or precompiled software.
- Use `/usr/local/` for compiled software or tools you want available system-wide.
- Use `~/.local/` for user-specific tools.

Let me know if you need help setting up a specific directory structure or permissions!

apt access this route? `/opt/`

Yes, `apt` does not access directories like `/opt/` or your home directory (`~/.local/`) by default. When you install software via `apt`, it typically installs packages in standard system directories such as:

- `/usr/bin/` (for executables)
- `/usr/lib/` (for libraries)
- `/etc/` (for configuration files)

However, directories like `/opt/` or `~/.local/` are commonly used for **manual installations**, such as when extracting a `.tar.gz` file, like Postman, or when installing software that isn't included in the official repositories.

To clarify:

- If you use **`apt`**, it will install packages in **system-wide directories** (e.g., `/usr/` or `/opt/` if it's configured that way).
- If you install Postman manually by extracting it to **`~/.local/`** or **`/opt/`**, **`apt` will not automatically manage** it because it doesn't track software installed outside of the package management system.

If you're referring to accessing Postman in your home directory or `/opt/` via the terminal or application menu:

1. **Accessing via Terminal**: You would run Postman directly from the path where you extracted it, for example:
    
    - From `/opt/`:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `/opt/Postman/Postman`
        
    - From `~/.local/share/Postman`:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `~/.local/share/Postman/Postman`
        
2. **Accessing via Application Menu**: If you create a `.desktop` entry for Postman (as described earlier), it will show up in the application menu regardless of whether it's installed in `/opt/`, `/usr/local/`, or `~/.local/`.
    

If you'd like to automate installation with `apt` (e.g., Postman is available as a package in some repositories), the software would need to be available in those repositories, or you would have to add a custom repository or download a `.deb` package to install it.
