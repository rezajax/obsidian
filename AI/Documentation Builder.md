For building documentation in Java and Kotlin, here are some of the top tools and libraries you can use:

### **Java Documentation Builders:**

1. **Javadoc**
    
    - **Description**: The official tool for generating API documentation in HTML format from Java source code.
    - **Features**: It parses Java source files with special doc comments (Javadoc comments) and generates formatted documentation.
    - **Usage**: Built into the JDK. It's very standard for Java projects.
    - **Website**: [Javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html)
2. **Dokka (for Kotlin & Java)**
    
    - **Description**: A documentation generator for Kotlin, which also supports Java. It produces high-quality documentation, including HTML, Markdown, and other formats.
    - **Features**: It supports both Java and Kotlin, with features like generating documentation from source code comments and support for Kotlin-specific features like extensions.
    - **Usage**: Typically used in Kotlin projects but supports Java code well.
    - **Website**: Dokka
3. **Swagger/OpenAPI**
    
    - **Description**: Primarily used for REST APIs, Swagger (OpenAPI) can generate detailed documentation for Java-based APIs.
    - **Features**: It creates interactive API documentation and supports annotations in the code to define models, operations, and endpoints.
    - **Usage**: Commonly used with Spring Boot or other Java frameworks for API documentation.
    - **Website**: [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)
4. **Asciidoctor**
    
    - **Description**: A flexible and powerful tool that can convert AsciiDoc files into various formats like HTML, PDF, etc. It's useful for generating more detailed project documentation.
    - **Features**: Provides rich formatting and can be integrated with Maven or Gradle for documentation generation.
    - **Website**: [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/)

### **Kotlin Documentation Builders:**

1. **Dokka**
    
    - **Description**: As mentioned earlier, Dokka is the go-to tool for Kotlin documentation. It provides rich, user-friendly documentation for Kotlin projects.
    - **Features**: It integrates well with Gradle, Maven, and other build systems. Supports multiple output formats like HTML, Markdown, and Javadoc-style output.
    - **Usage**: Commonly used in Kotlin-based projects for documentation generation.
    - **Website**: Dokka
2. **KDoc**
    
    - **Description**: Kotlin's own documentation system, similar to Java's Javadoc, using KDoc comments. It's designed to be part of the Kotlin ecosystem.
    - **Features**: Works seamlessly with Dokka, as KDoc comments are parsed by Dokka for generating documentation.
    - **Usage**: Used as part of Kotlin code to generate documentation in conjunction with Dokka.
3. **Kotlin API Documentation (Custom)**
    
    - **Description**: You can generate your own documentation pipeline with tools like **Jekyll** or **Hugo** combined with **Markdown** for static sites, often used for more custom, hand-crafted documentation needs.
    - **Features**: Provides flexibility for creating documentation that may include more than just API details, such as guides, tutorials, and examples.
    - **Website**: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
4. **MkDocs**
    
    - **Description**: A static site generator that's often used for project documentation. With its Markdown-based approach, it's flexible and easy to use.
    - **Features**: It's highly customizable, and with the appropriate plugins, you can generate documentation that includes Kotlin and Java code examples.
    - **Website**: [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org/)

---

### **Summary:**

- For **standard Java documentation**, **Javadoc** is the most common, but if you're working with Kotlin, **Dokka** is the preferred tool, as it supports both Kotlin and Java.
- **Swagger** or **OpenAPI** is great for documenting Java APIs.
- For more flexible, project-wide documentation (beyond just API docs), **Asciidoctor**, **MkDocs**, and **Jekyll** are excellent choices, depending on your format preferences.
